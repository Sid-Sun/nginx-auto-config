```

### Versioning system:

The version number consists of three parts, namely:

1: Major

2: Minor

3: Infant

Major version is to be updated when using the SAME config, the output generated will differ (ex: bug fix to the output generation system)

Minor version is to be updated when a feature is added or some other change made to the core system that doesn't affect how it behaves with the same effective input

Infant version is to be changed when the change doesn't affect the core system (ex: UX updates)

Versioning system follows a Trickle-down approach (i.e. the version part after the updated part is to be set to 0s)

While we recommend updating to each release, it is highly recommended to update on major and minor version changes
